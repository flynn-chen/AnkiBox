# AnkiBox

Tired of clicking through Anki decks? Here's how you can shadow-box while going through Anki.

## Description

This app uses the webcams on your laptop computer to take real-time images.
Then, it uses Blazepose, a deep learning model to identify human pose. 
Lastly, the pose is used to recognize punches as a part of a shadow-boxing routine.
